## Adding an app to the registry

Apps are added to the registry by adding an entry to the `apps.yaml` file within this repository.

*Feel free to propose a new app category to be added to [`category.yaml`](https://github.com/BIG-MAP/big-map-registry/edit/main/categories.yaml) before or after adding your app.*

1. Create a pull request to this repository that adds a new entry to the `apps.yaml` file, e.g., by [editing the file directly in the browser](https://github.com/BIG-MAP/big-map-registry/edit/main/apps.yaml?message=Add%20app%20%3Capp-name%3E). Example:

    ```yaml
    my-big-map-app:
      metadata:
        title: MyBIG-MAP app
        description: |
            My BIG-MAP app helps to promote accelerated discovery
            of novel battery materials.
        authors: A. Doe, B. Doe
        external_url: http://my-app.example.com
        documentation_url: https://my-big-map-app.readthedocs.io
        logo: https://github.com/my-org/my-big-map-app/raw/main/logo.png
        state: development
        version: '1.1'
      categories:
        - technology-aiida
        - technology-ase
        - quantum
    ```

    **Note**: Only the metadata fields `title` and `description` are mandatory.

2. Your app will show up in the [BIG-MAP App Store](https://big-map.github.io/big-map-registry) once your pull request is approved and merged.

**Tip**: The app store supports the `$ref` syntax to reference externally hosted documents.
That means you can reference metadata that is hosted at a different location, which makes it easier to dynamically update it.
For example, if you place a `metadata.yaml` file within your app repository, then you can reference that file in the app store like this:

```yaml
my-big-map-app:
  metadata:
    $ref: https://github.com/my-org/my-big-map-app/raw/main/metadata.yaml
```
You can even reference only parts of the metadata, example:
```yaml
my-big-map-app:
  metadata:
    title: MyBIG-MAP app
    description:
      $ref: https://github.com/my-org/my-big-map-app/raw/main/metadata.yaml#description

```

*The app store will assume that external references are in JSON format unless the referenced path ends with `.yaml` or `.yml`.*
